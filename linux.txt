4. `rm -rf WSL/` -> remove directories

5. `cp file1.txt filecp.txt` -> copy source file and new file name

6. `mv file3.txt ./test/` -> move files
	`mv test testnew` can use mv to rename


working with file content
-------------------------------

1. `head -5 file3.txt` -> shows first 5 lines of a file

2. `tail file3.txt` -> shows last 10 lines of file

3. echo -> 

	`echo "This is a kind person" > file1.txt`
	
	creates a file and writes the string on it

3. cat -> print all the content of file, concatenate multiple files

	`cat file2.txt file3.txt` -> shows content of both files onto terminal together

	`cat file2.txt file3.txt > all.txt` -> copied content of both files into target file

	`cat > somefile.txt` -> create a file and let you write sentences onto it -> press ctrl+d to save

	`cat file1.txt > otherfile.txt` -> use cat to copy files
